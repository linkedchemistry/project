Linked Chemistry
================

"Linked Chemistry" is a project all about Linked Open Data for chemistry. The demo website resides at
http://linkedchemistry.info/ but the project goes beyond that.

Principles
==========

1. Semantic: we use Resource Description Framework and ontologies
2. Linked: we link databases and chemistry
3. Open: we use CCZero

Project 1: Chemical Graphs
==========================

Chemical graphs are the common representation for small organic molecules. This first demo project
will work around chemical graphs, in particularly graphs with explicit double bond positions. That
is, it works with InChIs with the FixedH layer turned on.

The exact details and requirements for this will crystallize in the next weeks.
